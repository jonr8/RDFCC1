Club Time Trials have come back in style with 20 riders completing this week’s time trial – 2 laps of the Cannop loop – 2 big climbs and two crazy alpine descents before finishing in the heart of the Forest.

Louise Hart took more than 6 minutes off the club course record for the 12+ mile course, whilst Colin Parry again took the win in the men’s field.

We look forward to seeing you all at the next time trial on 28th July at Lydbrook for the Lydbrook 10. More information can be found on the Time trial dates and course info.
