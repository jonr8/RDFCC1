Time Trials returned to the Forest after a nationwide absence in 2020. Pent up energy saw 18 starters and finishers, a new women’s course record and some great support. Jared Linden’s new Time Trialling App got it’s latest beta run, and proved to deliver results as soon as the last rider finished.

Huge kudos to all riders, not least Louise Hart, who took 2 minutes and 33 seconds off her own course record, and men’s winner, Colin Parry, just short of his own course record. Many PBs all round and a few course newbies. Here’s looking forward to the next one on 21st July: Cannop x 2 (see Time Trial Course Info). Hopefully see you there!
