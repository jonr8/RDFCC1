Seven out on the first official ride out since the easing of Lockdown restrictions.
Matt Neale led the ride out from Parkend, along with Claire Jackson, Tom Cotterell, Martin Howitt, Neil Vaughan Jo Hussey and myself in tow.

Forty fantastic miles out towards Ross before peeling off in Walford, the through the lane and across the beautiful Linton Ridge. Back to Parkend via Mitcheldean and Blakeney.

A quick coffee in Dean Forest Cycles ended a perfect day out on the bike
