18 Riders "wheeled" the line for the first RDFCC Club time trial and the hilly Lydbrook 15.

Fast times were recorded with a number of PBs. Louise Hart in 3rd place overall took her own course record by 2 minutes 33, with Michelle Lee second lady, less than 30 seconds behind. Claire Jackson took 3rd place, providing a great turn out for the women’s event. In the men’s event, Colin Parry took the win, chased by Owen Burgess of Newport Phoenix, also recording a 2 minute 30 second course record!

It looks like everyone has been training hard despite the restrictions in place and the difficulties this presents. Well done everyone!
