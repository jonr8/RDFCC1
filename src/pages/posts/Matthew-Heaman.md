**If you could have one super power, what would it be?**

As a Heaman I already have several super powers but I would add the ability to fly to my current list.

**What has been your guilty pleasure during lockdown and the last year?**

Buying a gravel bike and sneaking out on it as often as I can.

**Why, when and how did you get into cycling?**

My father was an international rider back in the late 50’s and early 60’s so cycling was always a thing at home and he had many ex-rider friends that we mixed with so we often went off to watch races. I started riding with CC Weymouth in 1979 and competed in club and open TT’s and road races from then on.

**What's your greatest sporting or personal achievement?**

I am most proud of doing a 1:57 in a 50. Holding it together for that long came as a bit of surprise and I think is my best result to date. What is the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for you? No one thing, but several years ago I was in a very difficult place and a group of my friends supported me through this time. They were always there for me and made a huge difference to my wellbeing.

**Here's £5k :-) What are you going to spend it on?**

Thank you. I’m off to Dick Lovett Motorbikes’ to put it down as a deposit on a BMW GS 1250. Getting through Chepstow first thing in the morning pre lock down was a total nightmare so I’ve taken my bike tests and need a big adventure bike in my life!

**What achievement outside of sport are you most proud of?**

I was very proud to elected as the regional Chair of the British Council of Offices. Pretty boring stuff but recognition of my position in the south west property and construction market.

**What food could you not live without?**

Curry. Definitely curry.

**Book or film?**

Film – Deer Hunter please.

**If you had a one way plane ticket, where would it take you and why?**

Nice. I have spent many happy holidays cycling around all parts of Provence and could happily retire down there.

**Do you have a nickname you can tell us about?**

Eddy. For some reason when I went to sixth form I put my full name on my folders and Eddy (Edward is my middle name) was all I was called from then. Nearly 40 years later old school friends still call me that.

**What is the naughtiest or funniest thing you've been involved in that you can talk about?**

I was once involved in painting some rather unkind comments about my headmaster on the flat roof of my grammar school. We knew that there was an aerial photo planned of us all out on the playing fields to celebrate some anniversary and the helicopter tried for a long time to find an angle that didn’t take in the roof. They failed and as this was in 1984 there no Photoshop and the crude attempts to hide our handy work also failed and it made the front page in the Dorset Evening Echo.

**What's your favourite coffee/cake stop when on your bike?**

I love the coffee stall on the Leigh Woods side of the Clifton Suspension Bridge. Great coffee and views.
