On January 20th, 2021 the club held an online presentation of the awards presented for 2020. Sadly, the Covid pandemic had prevented a face-to-face meeting at the end of 2020. Most trophies are available to be collected if your individual exercise should bring you to Bream. Contact Matt Neale for more info. Most of the awards were linked to the time trial season but a few others were “presented” as well. The Club Best All Rounder (CBAR) results are in classes (colour coded) fastest to slowest.

CBAR
Red class (male) Dave Bucknall
Red class (female) Louise Hart
Blue class (male) Jon Mansell
Blue class (female) Claire Jackson
Black class (male) Matt Neale
Black class (female) No riders
Best Junior Ben Morgan
Best Juvenile Zach Rusling
Best Ross DCC rider Robin Drewett
Veteran Hill climb Jon Mansell
Seniors Hill climb (male) Craig Buffry
Seniors Hill climb (female) Louise Hart
Junior Hill climb Ben Morgan
Audax Rider (most AUK points) Ant Pollard
Best 50-mile TT Michelle Lee
Moment of Mirth Emily Baggers
Club personality of the Year Michelle Lee
Most of these are self-explanatory but the following will benefit from some explanation.

The Moment of Mirth trophy goes to a club member who has made the rest of us laugh at some point in the year. Emily managed to ride of a wide flat path into a water course for no apparent reason. It being –1c added to the entertainment factor.

Michelle was declared Club personality of the year for several reasons, all worthy of the award by themselves. Her riding has seen several attempts on national records, and I believe she has at least one of them. She has played a major part in the movement to introduce equal prizes across the classes within British Time Trialing and she has been the driving force behind the re-vamp of the club website. Well done Michelle!

As you can see, despite the limitations on our year club members have managed to keep themselves active. Let's hope that in 2021 we can get back to normal, or in the case of our TT events, replicate our better than normal participation.
