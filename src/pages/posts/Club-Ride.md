5 out on the road ride, the splitters went off with Emily's off road ride :-)

Chairman Matt bailed out at Trellech blaming a mechanical, consensus was it was his knees making the odd noises. The remaining quartet continued down Cwmcarvan through Raglan to Usk for coffee and cake. Refueled the climb up Wentwood stretched the legs. Left at the top towards Devauden where Sarah took the less hilly route home. 

The trio continued down to Tintern with Andy pulling hard on the front to Brockweir , then Tom showed his younger legs scampering up Brockweir - final climb of the day!
