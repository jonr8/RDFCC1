For the 2024 Season we have got back our Lydbrook courses after a few years with traffic lights beyond Kern Bridge. So while the basic Club TT calendar is much as normal we have put on a fair few Lydbrooks. The 1km Sprints at the start and finish are retained and by popular demand we have added another Hill Climb. There are now 4 HCs in the calendar - the “normal” end of season Fetter and Speech House Hill Climbs - and along with Bigswier mid season we have Ross’s Long Hill Climb up the Cats Hill to Ruardean. We expect to see a few Ross riders on this and other events as Ross are not running their Thursday TTs this season.

All the CTT course numbers have been changed - apparently they didn’t fit into the new CTT course numbering rules… there is now a very good course map on the CTT website Find Courses that provides the Risk Assessment for each listed course. Ours should all be there and are also shown [here](../../timetrials/timeTrialCourses) - but for the location of the sign on please check on the RDFCC web site - and as always please check on the FB group before the event in case there are issues on the night.

Finally - the entry fee will remain at £4 per rider, but we will not be offering the “full season” payment option as in previous years.

**The full time trial calendar can be found [here](../../timetrials/).**

Hope to see you there - John.
