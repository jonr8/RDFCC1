Good race last night. Although only 4 of use made the start line, Stephen Pritchard had technical issues and couldn't get going. Matthew Heaman , Paul Jones and myself did a nice 3 up time trial for the first 10miles until we hit Box Hill. Paul tried an early attack using his "featherweight" power up as we pulled away from Matt. The boost ran out then Paul couldn't hang on to me up the rest of the climb and that's how it stayed to the finish. Good work out was had by all.
