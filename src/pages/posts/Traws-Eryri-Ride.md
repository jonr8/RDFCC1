In May some members of the club will ride the Traws Eryri (Traws rhymes with mouse, Eryri is eh-ruh-ree, and it means Trans Snowdonia). 

A Cycling UK route that was created recently, it's 200km long and has 4,500m climbing. The route starts in Machynlleth in south Eryri, and ends in Conwy on the north coast. The Traws Eryri is a mountain bike route, and we'll be using hardtail mountain bikes carrying some overnight kit. We’ll be packing light, and travelling fast because in addition to the main route, we will be riding some of the many mtb trails that we'll pass. The itinerary will be four days riding, and three nights staying at hostels and inns.

Itinerary for 3 nights – 50km per day
