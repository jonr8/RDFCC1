The group set off as the bells were striking nine. A quick warm up to Bream before dropping into the Wye Valley. After passing approximately 47890 other cyclists we crossed the Severn Bridge. A brief debate was had as to whether it was a hill or not...it was decided that it was.

National cycle route 41 was taken to Slimbridge where we treated to a coffee (from a machine) at the Black Shed.

Feeling refreshed the group set off for Gloucester. After avoiding the glass and burnt out cars on the cycle track through town, the riders used the back lanes of Northwood Green and Flaxley to work their way back to Parkend. Everyone relished going up the Widow Maker with 65+ miles in their legs.

Back at Parkend Steve decided to try and bunny hop the kerb back into the Fountain and predictably fell off.

In all 80 great miles.

Special mention to Digby who rode to the start from Chepstow...and rode back...then still had enough energy to take his young son for a ride...112 miles in total....Urber Kudos.
