On Friday 21st January 2022 with a last minute green for go, Michelle Lee set off to the other side of the world landing in Buenos Aires for the beginning of quite a remarkable adventure ahead of her.

With various border issues due to COVID still causing problems, her route has to be fluid but the intention is to ride from Argentina, through to North America over the next seven months.

Michelle is documenting her travels through her blog;
