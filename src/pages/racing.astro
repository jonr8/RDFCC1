			<h2 class="font-bold py-2">CLUB RIDES & EVENTS</h2>

			<h3 class="font-semibold py-2">Come and join in!</h3>

			<p class="py-4">
				Racing is not for everyone, but the club makes it fun! All you
				need is a bike, a helmet, a rear light, a front light and a
				thirst ;-)
			</p>
			<p class="py-4">
				RDFCC regularly runs Time Trials on a Tuesday night through the
				summer months, and you may see many members at the local and
				regional CTT organised events.
			</p><p class="py-4">
				*** New CTT rules stipulate all participants in CTT affiliated
				TimeTrials (which RDFCC's are) MUST now have a front light as
				well as a rear. Also, helmets must always be worn, previously
				helmets were not required for hill climbs***
			</p><p class="py-4">
				Whilst the focus in the club is largely time trials, some
				members race Cyclocross (CX), Mountain Bike (MTB), Criteriums
				and Road Races.
			</p>
			<p class="py-4">
				If you're not sure, why not speak with one of the club members
				or comment on the Facebook page - lots of people to take you
				under their wing and get you up and rolling!
