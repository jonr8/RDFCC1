A resurrection of a past event and continuing a cycling tradition of proving how well you have been riding over the winter. 100 miles of quiet roads, route to be provided near the day, but roughly clockwise around the Malverns. Unsupported but I suggest you get together with some mates. Probably a softie Euro 100 as well or maybe even shorter. Watch this space for more details.
